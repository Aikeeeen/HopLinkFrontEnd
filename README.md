First open GitHub Desktop and click on current repository
<img width="966" height="656" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b0aede-a2f6-4f63-babd-02d67069aa75" />

Click on add and then clone repository (You have to be logged in on Github Desktop with your GitHub account for this)
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daeb2b3f-2138-416d-84ba-1d47f65989c8" />

For me it shows a few but for you it should show one which is HopLinkFrontEnd, click on that and then click on clone
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0d6caf-27fb-4426-912f-365320f0f1ef" />

After you've cloned it you should create a branch with a fitting name like 'requests' or whatever so you can start coding
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8a23ed-2348-4e87-b454-916e3294023a" />

You can now open it in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the button that says Visual Studio Code
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd7e191-8264-42cc-9739-9afa4fb5f3b1" />

In there you click 'Trust the authors'

Then open a terminal
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dc466b8-9e9b-4e24-a5c5-418c10980193" />

Then in your terminal type 'cmd' and press enter
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf42cf1-64dc-4f53-851c-b8ef0dfddf96" />

Now type in 'npm install' and press enter
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0d5e2a1-4a8f-4f65-8c68-61c24c5dae7d" />

After it has installed the packages (without any hickups) you have to type in 'npm run dev' and press enter
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a28bd7f2-7791-41d1-9c0a-bb3dc5babbde" />

That starts your local server. Then ctrl + left click to open it in your browser or type in 'http://localhost:5173/' in your browser
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d946ed7c-ae90-402c-be8f-4f14cafb2dc8" />

In your explorer on the left you can open 'src' and then 'components' or 'pages'. This is where you'll be creating files/components.
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ecc1b85-1a7a-4036-9b3b-485d30c3c11e" />

To create a new file you right click on the folder where you want a new file. So for example I want a page for 'Requests'
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/373a6023-8cca-4d0b-bbba-b41b49026dff" />

You type in the name of the page or component and at the end you type '.jsx'. If you don't it will not be recognized as a component
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57709eed-60ac-41e4-99f1-aa548b2adb69" />

In the newly made page you paste your code and press ctrl + s to save it and it'll automatically reload the local server
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68067d2c-c0d6-49f8-bdde-81cb2156fbdf" />

Since I'm adding a page this route needs to be added to both the desktop and mobile nav.
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c535b066-d5ab-44df-a48f-d80e5e664439" />

And also to the router in App.jsx
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1cda626-001e-4152-9993-ea9aa944c56b" />

Everytime you change something just hit ctrl + s and it'll save and immediately show on the local host
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45917a2a-db67-463a-8e90-f82d36058b5c" />

For adding a component to a page you don't need to change anything about the router since that is mainly for navigation. If you create a component you add it in the page and import it there but ChatGPT or another AI will help you out with that most likely.
